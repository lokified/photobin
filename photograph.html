But due to technologies that have come,it is now easier to take photos without the struggle of paintings. Everyone can take a photo since it is now integrated into our smart phones. But having a camera on phone does not make you a perfect photographer sometimes we need to go through some training to get a well set photo of yourself or any other thing.
